# Personal Finance Dashboard Frontend 

This repository contains the source code for the Personal Finance Dashboard, built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (with the Chart.js library for visualization). It fulfills all requirements, including responsive design and local data storage.

## How to Run the Application

The application uses standard web technologies and must be run using a local web server due to browser security restrictions (CORS policy).

### Easiest Method (VS Code Live Server)

1.  Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed.
2.  Install the "Live Server" extension (by Ritwick Dey).
3.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
4.  Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server."
